# Rogue

Do you believe that this website is occupied by a rogue? Actually, the penguin gang has been wandering around the town and caused a lot of troubles!

```c
#include "penguin.h"

int main()
{
    penguin penguin; // This code spawns a penguin gangster
    penguin_init_gangster(&penguin);
    penguin_create_a_big_trouble(&penguin);
    return 0;
}
```

I am **NOT** joking! There are penguins :penguin: everywhere in this website!!!
